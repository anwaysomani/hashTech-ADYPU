				This course aims to provide an introduction to the basic principles, techniques, and applications of Machine Learning. Programming assignments are used to help clarify basic concepts.<br>
				The course covers the principles, design and implementation of learning programs that improve their performance on some set of tasks with experience. Upon successful completion of the course, students will have a broad understanding of machine learning algorithms and their use in data-driven knowledge discovery and program synthesis. Students will have designed and implemented several machine learning algorithms in Java. Students will also be able to identify, formulate and solve machine learning problems that arise in practical applications. Students will have a knowledge of the strengths and weaknesses of different machine learning algorithms (relative to the characteristics of the application domain) and be able to adapt or combine some of the key elements of existing machine learning algorithms to design new algorithms as needed. You will have an understanding of the current state of the art in machine learning and be able to begin to conduct original research in machine learning.<br>
